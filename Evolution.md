## Evolution of Evolution
### Linnaeus
- Classification by 'relatedness', which was by Creator's design
### Lamarck
- Life has originated by many times
- from recently originated, simple forms of life to older, more complex forms
- we now see a hierarchy of species because they differ in age
- inheritance of acquired characteristics
### Darwin
- Natural selection
	- what changed is the frequency of a variant form, not the individuals
	- for the **adaptions**
- descent with modification
- Gradualism: changes by steps, not by leaps
- Populational change
- big gap: blending inheritance
	- solved by Mendel's **particulate inheritence**
### Neo-Lamarckism
- **Orthogenesis**: aka straight-line evolution, that a species evolves in a predetermined direction by some kind of internal drive, without the aid of natural selection
- **Mutationlist**: discretely different new phenotypes can arise by a process of mutation
### The evolutionary synthesis
- aka modern synthesis, or neo-Darwinsim
- microevolution/macroevolution
### Neutral theory of molecular evolution
- Motoo Kimura
- most of the evolution of DNA sequences occurs by chance (genetic drift) rather than by natural selection
## Tree
- ![[life-tree.png]]
- **LUCA**:**L**ast **U**niversal **C**ommon **A**ncestor
- true plants comes from green algae
- based on homologous
- **Horizontal gene transfer** can make tree net-like
- α1&β2: out-paralogous, duplication before speciation; also in-paralogous means speciation before duplication![[paralogousorthologous.png]]
- ![[hemoglobin&myoglobin.png]]
- **molecular clock**: no universal one6
